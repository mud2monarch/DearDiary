# Zach's diary
For the past 1-2 months I've been more seriously studying computer programming. This includes (to my friend's chagrin) learning Rust. See [https://github.com/mud2monarch/rustbook](https://github.com/mud2monarch/rustbook) for more. 

This file has random assorted snippets of things i'm thinking. train of consciousness and not likely to include capitalization at times. hopefully not too unhinged. I think this will end up reverse-chronological.

I've been learning a lot about all the different languages. One thing that I think is so cute about computer scientists is that they adopt these catch phrases that stem from canonical resources for teaching. For example, the boar book about efficient data systems is a meme. Rust is Blazingly Fast and has Fearless Concurrency. Even when people are talking about other things they still accede the meme. I haven't been in another ecosystem that is SO BIG (there are 10s of millions of coders!) but still maintains these memetics. Maybe because it is mostly American-dominated, at least culturally? So it's actually not that big of an ecosystem as you might think?

I also notice that crypto phrases spread to coding culture. Like ngmi.
